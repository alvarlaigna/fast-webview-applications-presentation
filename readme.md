full blog post available at http://maxogden.com/fast-webview-applications

for talk notes see `talk-notes.md`

to run the examples you must:
  - be on a Mac
  - install XCode and the iOS SDK
  - install Cordova 1.7 or above and 
  - double click on each .xcodeproj file to open them

otherwise you can just serve the `www` folder and run them in a normal browser to get the general idea
